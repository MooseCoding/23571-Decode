# 23571's Team Code for Decode FTC season

## TO DO LIST

- [ X ] Auto Docs

- [ ] Subsystems

- [ ] TeleOP code

- [ ] Auto code

## So whats going on with this

All the actual code is located in 
<https://github.com/MooseCoding/23571-Decode/tree/main/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode>.

Dairy is our teleop programming folder and
pedropathing is our autonomous. I've commented
a lot of the teleop code already so feel free to look thru it
and judge :). The teleop code structure will be in a readme
file inside of the folder and I'll do the same for the auto code in due time.

Good luck programmers
