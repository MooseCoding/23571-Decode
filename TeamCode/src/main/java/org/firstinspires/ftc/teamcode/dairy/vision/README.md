Vision is where we'll house our code for any needed camera system be it LimeLight or OpenCV we'll get it done guys.

# Vision Instructions

Put whatever vision code we'll need in this folder, main thing will be our Camera.kt file where we'll handle everything inside of, 
but we can have other files that handle parts.
