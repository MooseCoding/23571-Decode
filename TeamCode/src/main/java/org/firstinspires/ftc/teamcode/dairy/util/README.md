# Explanation

Util is the general purpose folder for any needed objects/classes like a waiter.
By itself, its useless meant to facilitate the other functions and programs we write. 
It's meant to make our lives easier and better in any way. If you'd like something
and I have not included it, please talk to me and I'll either make a specific fix for you or 
a util class.
